# CO2 Regression:
This code used the *co2_regression* dataset described in the dissertation. 

All the code files need to be in a folder named **code**, and the data in a folder named **data**. In order for the code to work we require that the structure of the *co2_regression* folder is kept. 

All scripts can be ran using the **terminal**, by first navigating to the *code* folder.

Once you have navigated to the right folder you can run each script as follows:

***1. make_data_files.py***

This script makes the specific **training** and **test** datasets that are used in the dissertation. Please note that they are already in the **data** folder. 

To run the files type the following command in the terminal:
  1. [LINUX:]
  python make_data_files.py
  2. [Windows:]
  py.exe make_data_files.py
