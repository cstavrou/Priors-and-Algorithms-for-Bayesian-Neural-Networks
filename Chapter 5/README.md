# Chapter 5

All the code used in Chapter 5 of my dissertation can be found in this folder. Please note that the specific structure of the folders is essential as the datasets need to be accessed and the output files need to be stored with consistency.

It is highly recommended when looking at the Chapter 5 scripts to start from the **co2_regression** folder as that has more explanation on how to use the terminal in order to use the scripts.
