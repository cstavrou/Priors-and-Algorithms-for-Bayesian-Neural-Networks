# Small MNIST dataset

This is the MNIST dataset with 2000 training and 2000 test examples (explained in the dissertation). The script to create the dataset can be found in the **code** folder.

In this section we have all the code used to create the feed-forward and Bayesian neural networks explored in the dissertation, along with the scripts used to create any plots or results that are found in the dissertation. Please note that the scripts are flexible to changes in the model, and thus cover a larger scope than has been shown in the dissertation.
