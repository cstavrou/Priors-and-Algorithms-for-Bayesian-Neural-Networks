# Priors and Algorithms for Bayesian Neural Networks

This repository contains all the data and code used in my Master's dissertation. You can find an implementation of **feed-forward neural networks**, **Bayesian neural networks** using **Variational Inference** and others using **MCMC (HMC and SGHMC)**. The implementations are limited to the **MNIST** and **Mauna Loa (CO2 regression)** datasets.

The code in the repository includes any script that was used to create the datasets used, and to make any graphics used in the dissertation. Each folder contains a **README** file explaining the output of the different scripts in that folder, and how they can be used.
